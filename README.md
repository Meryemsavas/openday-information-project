# Open Day Website - Software Developer

This is our school project website for the Open Day of the Software Developer Program at Techniek College Rotterdam. The website includes a quiz, a talent tree, and a chatbot to inform visitors about the Software Developer Program and explore their interests in software development.

## Functionalities

- **Quiz & Mario Game**🍄🍄: Our website features a quiz where visitors can answer simple questions with either "yes" or "no". Based on their responses, the quiz generates a result indicating whether they might be suited for a career in software development or not.

- **Talent Tree**🌳🌳: Visitors can navigate through the talent tree to explore different aspects of software development covered in our program. Each branch of the tree leads to detailed information about a specific skill or technology.

- **Chatbot**📫📫: The chatbot is ready to answer visitors' questions and assist them in finding relevant information about the Software Developer Program, such as admission requirements, course structure, and career prospects.

## Tools Used 🛠️
